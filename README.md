# RoadScan Solutions Team ü§ù

Welcome to the GitHub profile of RoadScan Solutions Team! We are dedicated to developing innovative solutions for improving road infrastructure. Our flagship project, **AI-Driven Road Quality Detection for Accessibility and Safety**, utilizes cutting-edge AI technology to assess and improve road conditions.

## AI-Driven Road Quality Detection for Accessibility and Safety üöß

This project aims to automate the process of road quality assessment using computer vision and machine learning.  Our system analyzes images and videos of roads to identify various defects such as potholes, cracks, and uneven surfaces, providing valuable data for maintenance and planning.


**Technology Stack:**

* **Python üêç:** Our primary programming language.
* **Ultralytics YOLO üöÄ:**  Powerful object detection framework for accurate and efficient defect identification.
* **Tkinter üñ•Ô∏è:**  Used for creating the user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).
* **[Add other libraries here] üìö:**  List any other relevant libraries used (e.g., OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas).


**Project Status:**  [In Development and to be completed]
